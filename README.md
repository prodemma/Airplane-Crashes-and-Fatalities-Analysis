# Airplane-Crashes-and-Fatalities-Analysis
This dataset showcases Boeing 707 accidents that have occurred since 1948. The dataset includes information on over 5000 airplane crashes around the world. This analysis is crucial to reduce the number of aircraft accidents by the studying aircrafts, locations, map routes and seasons mostly involved with such. 

📝 KPIs
-Crash Locations: 4304
-Operators: 2470
-Passengers Aboard: 145,000
-Fatalities: 105,000
-Survivals: 39,000 

 📝 Aim
- To plot a map of all routes 
- The type of aircraft involved in the most crashes ?
- Patterns where/when crashes occur 

📝 Insights
-The aircraft with the most crashes were found to be Douglas DC-3 with a total of 334 crashes. 
-The top crash locations were at Bogota-Colombia, Kunming-China and Sao Paulo-Brazil with 4 crashes each. 
-The winter season contributed mostly to crashes by 26.7%. 
-Most crashes occurred on Thursdays with a total of 818 crashes 

 📝Recommendation
The Douglas DC-3 aircraft should be checked for airworthiness for all airlines and those faulty, retired. Flights during the winter should be avoided except in emergency situations.  Geographic Risk Assessments should be taken for countries like Bogota-Colombia, Kunming-China and Sao Paulo-Brazil. This will no doubt reduce the chances of accidents in air travels.
